  <br/>
	<li>DONATION EXTENSION:
		<ul class="second">
			<li>Users can donate their points to another user.</li>
			<li>Users with at least 1 point can use this function. Because minimum donation is set as 1 point to avoid zero point or minus point donations. And maximum points will automatically set as the users total points. So, a user with 100 points total, cannot donate more than 100 points.</li>

			<li>UPDATE 27/05/2024: Stoping/Cancelling promotion is added. Post Owner or Admins (specified userlevels) can stop/cancel/remove post from promotion. This is beneficial to control non-relevant, spam, ad, low quality posts from being promoted.</li>
			<li>UPDATE 27/05/2024: When promoted post is stopped/cancelled, it will not refund the cost (points) deducted from promoter user to promote the post. The logic here is to avoid spamming on promotion/cancellation processes.</li>
			<li>UPDATE 27/05/2024: When promoted post is stopped/cancelled, the system will set 24-hour ambargo period for this post. It means after cancellation of promotion, the post cannot be re-promoted until 24-hour ambargo period ends. The logic here is to avoid spamming on promotion/cancellation processes.</li>
